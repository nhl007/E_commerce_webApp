// Define your ranking criteria: Before you start ranking your products, you need to decide which factors are important for your ecommerce web application. Some common criteria include popularity, sales performance, customer ratings, profit margin, and inventory levels.

// Collect data: Once you have defined your ranking criteria, you need to collect the relevant data for each product. This may include sales data, customer feedback, and inventory levels.

// Analyze the data: Use statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and correlations in your data. This will help you determine which products should be featured or recommended based on your ranking criteria.

// Implement your ranking algorithm: Once you have analyzed your data and determined your ranking algorithm, you need to implement it in your ecommerce web application. This may involve integrating a third-party recommendation engine or building your own custom algorithm.

// Test and refine: Finally, you should test your product ranking system and refine it based on user feedback and performance metrics. This will help you ensure that your system is accurately recommending products that your customers will be interested in.

// Overall, setting up a product ranking system to show featured and recommended products requires careful planning, data collection and analysis, and ongoing testing and refinement. By following these steps, you can build an effective product ranking system that will improve the user experience and increase sales for your ecommerce web application.

// Sample product data
const products = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Product 1', views: 100, sales: 10 },
  { id: 2, name: 'Product 2', views: 200, sales: 5 },
  { id: 3, name: 'Product 3', views: 50, sales: 15 },
  { id: 4, name: 'Product 4', views: 300, sales: 20 },
  { id: 5, name: 'Product 5', views: 750, sales: 25 },
];

// Simple ranking algorithm based on popularity (views + sales)
function rankProducts(products) {
  const rankedProducts = products.sort((a, b) => {
    const aPopularity = a.views + a.sales;
    const bPopularity = b.views + b.sales;
    return bPopularity - aPopularity;
  });
  return rankedProducts;
}

// Call the ranking function and print the result
const rankedProducts = rankProducts(products);
// console.log(rankedProducts);
